Warhammer 40k's [Black Library](https://www.blacklibrary.com/) is junk food for readers, an expansive universe filled with mediocre fiction yet detailed lore. _Brutal Kunnin'_ separates itself from the rest with a light-hearted style framed by some fun and dramatic set pieces. Brooks also highlights a faction not often represented, a welcome change from the space marine standard.
