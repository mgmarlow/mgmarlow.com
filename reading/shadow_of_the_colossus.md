[Boss Fight books](https://bossfightbooks.com/) tend to be hit or miss, although those who love reading about the history, ideas, and impact of video games will find enjoyment in their tales. The books are at their best when they refrain from summarizing the plot of the game under inspection, focusing more on the interpersonal connection between game and author, or creator and development. My favorite in the series, [Spelunky](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/spelunky-by-derek-yu), does the latter, detailing the game's secrets and development in extraordinary detail.

_Shadow of the Colossus_ doesn't quite hit the mark. The author talks up a deep connection with the game, but does little to articulate that connection to the reader. Suttner focuses instead on what the game means in broad terms, an analysis too impersonal to accomplish the author's stated objective.

That said, the author does hide some delightful subtle touches throughout the book, like setting the number of pips in the paragraph separators equal to the number of remaining colossi in his playthrough. He also pulls in some interesting research notes from the game's director, Fumito Ueda, describing in some detail the thoughts behind the game's expansive world and immersive storytelling devices; or scouring forums for tidbits of Shadow culture and intrigue.

Overall, an enjoyable read that lacks a certain level of insight or personability to make it a full success.
