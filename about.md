# About

Hello, I'm Graham. I'm a software engineer who likes to [build games](https://mgmarlow.itch.io/), write about my [Emacs obsession]({{ '/tags/emacs' | url }}), and occasionally contribute to [open source](https://github.com/mgmarlow/). Some of my recent projects include [swapper](https://mgmarlow.itch.io/swapper), [shuffle hustle](https://shuffle-hustle.com), and [notion-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/mgmarlow/notion-sdk-ruby).

You can read my [articles]({{ '/' | url }}) on this blog or subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ '/feed.xml' | url }}), if that's your fancy.
