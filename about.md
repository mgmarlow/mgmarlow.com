I'm Graham, a software engineer who spends too much time on the internet.

I like to [build games](https://mgmarlow.itch.io/), write about my [Emacs obsession]({{ '/words/2022-05-02-learning-emacs' | url }}), and contribute to [open source](https://github.com/mgmarlow/). You can read my [articles]({{ '/' | url }}) on this blog or subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ '/feed.xml' | url }}). Some of my recent projects include [notion-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/mgmarlow/notion-sdk-ruby), [swapper](https://mgmarlow.itch.io/swapper), [knave-tools](https://github.com/mgmarlow/knave-tools).

I'm currently working on a programming podcast with my good friend [Nolan Sedley](https://nolansedley.netlify.app/). More details soon to come.

### About this site

I built this site with [Eleventy, Tailwind, and Stimulus](https://github.com/mgmarlow/mgmarlow.com), though I tend to rebuild it yearly. The design is heavily inspired by [Tom Macwright](https://macwright.com) and [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/); I encourage you to check out and support their work.

This site is ad-free and doesn't include any trackers. If you'd like to support my work you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mgmarlow).
