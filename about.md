# About me

Hello, I'm Graham. I'm a software engineer who likes to [build games](https://mgmarlow.itch.io/), write about my [Emacs obsession]({{ '/tags/emacs' | url }}), and contribute to [free & open source](https://github.com/mgmarlow/) software. You can read my [articles]({{ '/' | url }}) on this blog or subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ '/feed.xml' | url }}), if that's your fancy.

You might enjoy some of my Emacs packages:

- [clippy-flymake](https://sr.ht/~mgmarlow/clippy-flymake/): A Flymake backend for Clippy
- [store-git-link](https://sr.ht/~mgmarlow/store-git-link/): Share links to lines of code/commits
