Talking about _The Puzzler_ by A.J. Jacobs.

If you can ignore Jacobs musings on the virtues of puzzling (which is, despite
the book's subtitle, mercifully light), _The Puzzler_ offers some entertaining
stories about puzzle fanaticism. Just don't go in expecting much else.

Each chapter is about a blog-post's worth of content that follows a formula
common to every puzzle in the book. Most interesting are Jacobs's explorations
into puzzling esoterica, e.g. [Kryptos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos)
or the [MIT Mystery Hunt](https://puzzles.mit.edu/). Although the formula gets
tiring quickly, Jacobs keeps it alive by offering up historical puzzles that the
reader can peruse on their own terms.

None of what Jacobs provides would be so egregious if his tone and humor weren't
representative of the lowest common denominator of _The New York Times_ readers.
The repertoire of jokes at Jacobs disposal is seemingly limited to the political
and social circumstances of 2020, a time I'd much rather forget than reminisce
with the author's patronizing guidance.

Moreover, his grand ideas on the applicability of puzzles to everyday life are
marred by his inclusions of "nerd culture" stereotypes. At one point Jacobs asks
a Rubik's Cube aficionado whether his "Rubik's Cube renown led to him dating the
head cheerleader" (31).

Ultimately _The Puzzler_ is a disappointing read. Perhaps if the book were
instead a series of blog posts I would be more forgiving to its content and
meandering lack of purpose. But viewed as a whole, the book doesn't justify its
own existence.

**tl;dr**: read [Rex Parker](https://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/) instead.
