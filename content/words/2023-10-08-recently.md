Recently I've been tinkering with
[Crafted Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs), a modularized
Emacs starter kit. The project strongly invokes one of my favorite things about
the Emacs community: taking bits of insight from other configurations and
sprinkling them into your own. The modules from the framework are meant to be
extended or replaced, so they exemplify good Emacs Lisp style and are filled
smart ideas and thorough documentation.

The project is undergoing a major overhaul with its
[craftedv2RC1 branch](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/tree/craftedv2RC1)
but it's ready for general use (just don't forget to clone the right branch).
I've been using it for the past few weeks in a professional capacity and have
landed on a pretty lightweight configuration
([my config](https://git.sr.ht/~mgmarlow/crafted-config)). It's been a good
excuse to start experimenting with the new Emacs 29 Tree Sitter features, most
of which Crafted Emacs configures automatically.

Tree Sitter is actually surprising complicated to set up even with all of the
work that's gone into Emacs 29. Grammars are shipped separately from the editor,
so you need to install each one from its respective git repository and compile
it before you can use it. Emacs provides a few commands to help this process but
there's still lots of holes in the experience.

Thanks to Crafted Emacs I learned about
[treesit-auto](https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto), a library that strives
to make the Tree Sitter setup completely automatic. I imagine that as Tree
Sitter gains greater mindshare and major mode development lots of these issues
will be ironed out. Right now it feels a bit bleeding edge.

I discovered Crafted Emacs through the
[System Crafters](https://systemcrafters.net/) community, which by no
coincidence is also where I got started with Emacs a year or so ago. Lots of
friendly folks working on interesting things over there.

## Reading

I just finished up
_[The Wind-up Bird Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind-Up_Bird_Chronicle)_
and it's been lingering in my mind ever since. I really don't know how to
summarize my feelings about Murakami; I've read four of his books so far
(novels, short story collections, and his memoir) and yet I can't really say
whether I like his work. I suppose here I am reading and thinking about it, so
that must mean something.

Murakami's work walks a line of allegory and emotional expression that is
surprising given the simplicity of the prose. The style of writing is just so
_plain_ that it can't help but be compelling in its emotional density. His
references to musical pieces, drinking beer, and reading books reminds me of my
dad.

## Side projects

Crafted Emacs has been the bulk of my open source contribution lately but I've
also been messing around with [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/), a Lisp that
compiles to Lua. The killer feature for me is programming games with
[Love2D](https://love2d.org/) and avoiding Lua altogether, since I don't care
much for the language. Bonus points since it's a Lisp and I've been on a Lisp
kick for the last two years.

I don't have any big plans for the language other than to make a few games and
see what happens. Love2D is far and away my favorite game framework, having
worked with some alternatives like Raylib, HaxeFlixel, and Monogame. It's
well-documented and robust, yet remains simple and expressive. It also has an
extensive amount of community material and libraries that provide just about
everything you'd want in a 2D engine. Fortunately Fennel retains the ability to
use these libraries since it just compiles down to Lua.

I discovered Fennel via [Andrey Listopadov's blog](https://andreyor.st/), where
he documents some of his past games and some other really
[insightful posts](https://andreyor.st/posts/2022-09-26-reproducible-research-with-org-mode-fennel-and-love/).
