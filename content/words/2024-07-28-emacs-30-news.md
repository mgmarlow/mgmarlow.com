title: New stuff in Emacs 30
date: 2024-07-28

Whoa, the [Emacs 30 release
cycle](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-06/msg00746.html)
has officially started (I totally missed when this was announced a
month ago). We're still waiting on a [pretest
build](https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/), but that didn't stop
me from reading through the NEWS file and highlighting some of my
favorite changes.

These updates are hand-picked based on my interest, check out
[emacs-30/etc/NEWS](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/emacs-30/etc/NEWS)
for the full release notes.

## Native compilation enabled by default

This is huge! At least, for those who haven't already been using this
since the Emacs 28 opt-in. Native compilation has made a huge
performance difference for me, so I'm happy to see it enabled by
default.

## Native (and faster) JSON support

You no longer need an external library (`libjansson`) to work with
JSON in Emacs. On top of that, JSON parsing performance in Emacs is
significantly improved (the author provides that parsing is up to **8x
faster**). This is all thanks to Géza Herman's contribution: [I
created a faster JSON
parser](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-03/msg00244.html). He
summarizes his changes later in that thread:

> My parser creates Lisp objects during parsing, there is no
> intermediate step as Emacs has with jansson. With jansson, there are
> a lot of allocations, which my parser doesn't have (my parser has
> only two buffers, which exponentially grow. There are no other
> allocations). But even ignoring performance loss because of mallocs
> (on my dataset, 40% of CPU time goes into malloc/free), I think
> parsing should be faster, so maybe jansson is not a fast parser in
> the first place.

Great stuff.

## use-package `:vc` keyword

You can now install packages directly from version-controlled
repositories (for those packages that aren't yet in ELPA or MELPA).

Example:

```elisp
(use-package bbdb
  :vc (:url "https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/git/bbdb.git"
       :rev :newest))
```

This also means that you can opt into package updates based on commit
instead of latest release (e.g. `:rev :newest`). I think this is
actually a sleeper feature of `:vc`, since the default Emacs package
release/update cycle can be a little wonky at times.

If you want all of your `:vc` packages to prefer the latest commit
(instead of the latest release), you can set
`use-package-vc-prefer-newest` to `t`.

## Tree-sitter modes are declared as submodes

I had to read this change a few times before I grokked what it was
saying. Tree-sitter modes, e.g. `js-ts-mode`, are now submodes of
their non-tree-sitter counterpart, e.g. `js-mode`. That means any
configuration applied to the non-tree-sitter mode also applies to the
tree-sitter mode.

In other words, my `.dir-locals.el` settings for `js-mode` simply
apply to `js-ts-mode` as well, without needing to write it
explicitly. It's a nice quality-of-life change.

## Minibuffer QOL improvements

Some nice quality-of-life improvements for the default Emacs
completions:

- You can now use the arrow keys to navigate the completion buffer
  vertically (in addition to the `M-<up|down>` keybindings).

- Previous minibuffer completion selections are deselected when you
  begin typing again (to avoid accidentally hitting a previous
  selection).

- `completions-sort` has a new value: `historical`. Completion
  candidates will be sorted by their order in minibuffer history so
  that recent candidates appear first.

## Customize interface for dir-locals

There's now a customize interface for [Directory
Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html):

```txt
M-x customize-dirlocals
```

I always find myself forgetting the `.dir-locals.el` syntax (even
though they're just lists!) so this is a surprisingly handy feature
for me.

## New mode: `visual-wrap-prefix-mode`

Now this one is cool. I'm the kind of guy who uses `auto-mode` for
everything because I haven't bothered to figure out how Emacs line
wrapping works. Everything I write hard breaks into newlines after 80
characters.

The new mode `visual-wrap-prefix-mode` is like `auto-mode`, except
that the breaks are for display purposes only. I think this is
incredibly useful when editing text that might be reviewed using a
diffing tool, since long lines tend to display more useful diffs than
a paragraph broken up with hard breaks. I'm actually pretty excited
about this change, maybe it will get me to stop using `(markdown-mode
. (( mode . auto-fill))` everywhere.

## New command: `replace-regexp-as-diff`

You can now visualize regular expression replacements as diffs before
they're accepted. This is actually incredible.

## New package: `which-key`

Previously a package in GNU ELPA, `which-key-mode` is now
built-in. With `which-key-mode` enabled, after you begin a new command
(e.g. `C-x`) and wait a few seconds, a minibuffer will pop up with a
list of possible keybinding completions. It's a super handy tool for
remembering some of the more esoteric modes.

## New customizations

- Show the current project (via `project.el`) in your modeline with
  `project-mode-line`.

- Add right-aligned modeline elements via
  `mode-line-format-right-align`.

- You can now customize the venerable `yes-or-no-p` function with
  `yes-or-no-prompt`.

## A few ELisp changes

There are a few small, yet impactful changes around help buffers and
Emacs Lisp types that I think are worth noting.

- `describe-function` shows the function inferred type when available:
  
```txt
C-h f concat RET
```

```txt
(concat &rest SEQUENCES)

Type: (function (&rest sequence) string)
```

- Built-in types show their related classes:

```txt
C-h o integer RET
```

```txt
integer is a type (of kind ‘built-in-class’).
 Inherits from ‘number’, ‘integer-or-marker’.
 Children ‘fixnum’, ‘bignum’.
```

- The byte compiler warns if a file is missing the lexical binding
  directive. Lexical bindings have been included in ELisp for awhile
  now, so it's nice to see more effort being made towards making it
  the default.

```elisp
;;; Foo mode  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
```

That wraps up my read-through. There's obviously way more changes
included in Emacs 30, so I encourage you to check it out for yourself:
