title: Trying out Sourcehut

With Github's push towards [social
media-ification](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/13130)
and the questionable legality of [Github
Copilot](https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/) I find myself looking
at alternatives. The alternative that has surprised me the most is the
humble [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/) a completely [open source
platform](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sourcehut/) that offers paid
hosting.
