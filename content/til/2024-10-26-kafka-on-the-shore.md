On the inside cover of _Kafka on the Shore_ Murakami explains how his idea for
the book started with its title. This approach is opposite to anything I've ever
written, though I recognize there's a notable difference between fiction and
technical writing. But what a powerful idea: a simple phrase shapes the entire
story.

I dug up this quote from an interview:

> When I start to write, I don’t have any plan at all. I just wait for the story
> to come. I don’t choose what kind of story it is or what’s going to happen. I
> just wait.

I think that's pretty cool.
