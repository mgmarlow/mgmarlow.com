> Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want
> to live life to the fullest. If you're going to while away the years, it's far
> better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog, and I
> believe running helps you do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within
> your individual limits: that's the essence of running, and a metaphor for
> lifeâ€”and for me, writing as well. - Haruki Murakami
