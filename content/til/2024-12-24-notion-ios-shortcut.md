title: Automating Quick Notes with iOS Shortcuts

I've blogged before about why I really dislike apps like Notion for
[taking quick notes](/words/2024-10-30-why-apple-notes) since they're so slow to
open. The very act of opening the app to take said note often takes 10 or more
seconds, typically with a whole bunch of JavaScript-inflicted loading states and
blank screens. By the time I get to the note, I've already lost my train of
thought.

As it turns out, this painpoint is a perfect candidate for the iOS Shortcuts
app. I can create an automated workflow that captures my text input instantly
but pushes to Notion in the background, allowing me to benefit from Notion's
database-like organization but without dealing with the pitiful app performance.

Here's my Shortcut:

Super simple but it gets the job done.
