# Hi, I'm Graham Marlow.

I'm a software engineer based in California. I mostly blog about programming and
puzzles.

Here are some links to other areas where I'm active:

- [Github & open source](https://github.com/mgmarlow)
- [Crossword puzzles](https://crosshare.org/mgmarlow)
- [Games and jam submissions](https://mgmarlow.itch.io/)

Recently I added a [TIL]({{ '/til' | url }}) section to this site, following in
the steps of [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/09/new-microblog/). It's
a dumping ground for quotes, code snippets, and anything else that doesn't make
its way into a proper article.
