# Hi, I'm Graham Marlow.

I'm a software engineer based in California. I mostly blog about programming.

I have a bunch of code available for your perusal on my
[Github](https://github.com/mgmarlow). I'm also a casual
[crossword constructor](https://crosshare.org/mgmarlow) and occasional
[game jammer](https://mgmarlow.itch.io/), if either of those things spark your
interest. Feel free to send me a comment at [{{
site.author.email }}](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).
