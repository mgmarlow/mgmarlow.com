Talking about _Intro to Haiku_ by Harold Henderson.

The 17 syllable (5-7-5) structure of Japanese haiku doesn't necessarily translate well into English, so Henderson prefers English haiku in the realm of 12-15. There are a few interesting reasons for this difference:

- There are no articles (the, a, an, etc.) and very few pronouns in Japanese.
- Punctuation is replaced by cut-words that have no translatable meaning but increase syllable count.
- Different grammar rules contribute to a very different sentence structure.

That said, even with a shorter syllable count, short-long-short is still the recommended structure for haiku. The general guidelines for writing haiku are as follows.

- Follow a short-long-short rhythm with fewer than 17 syllables (often 12-15).
- Include a single break in meaning that compares two adjacent, though dissimilar ideas.
- Reflect on nature or one of the four seasons.
- Try to share an experience of awareness with the reader.

## Selected poems

(_translations by Harold Henderson_)

### Bashō

```
On a journey, ill,
  and over fields all withered,
    dreams go wandering still.
```

```
A lightning gleam:
  into darkness travels
    a night heron’s scream.
```

### Issa

```
A new year starting, but—
  it’s still just as it stands here,
    this ramshackle hut!
```

### Shiki

```
The mists come;
  the mountains fade and vanish;
    the tower stands alone.
```

```
Night; and once again,
  the while I wait for you,
    cold wind turns into rain.
```

```
Icy the moonshine:
  shadow of a tombstone,
    shadow of a pine.
```
