# Introducing ReScript

A few weeks ago I revisited ReScript and experimented with the ecosystem during Advent of Code. I was pleased to discover that the language is in a much better place than four years ago.

Although I don't think I'll be writing ReScript in production any time soon, I put together a presentation today to introduce it to my colleagues. You can find the full presentation notes here: [Introducing ReScript](https://mgmarlow.notion.site/Introducing-ReScript-250b25122ea54be2b14cb1099f087b44).

My hope is that these notes establish why ReScript is an interesting alternative to TypeScript, particularly the advantages of a sound type system. I'm pretty excited about the language, so I hope it continues to evolve in a positive direction.
