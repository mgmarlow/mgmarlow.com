title: My Year in Reading
date: 2023-01-07

I read 24 books in 2023, a total of just over 8,000 pages. It was an
uncommonly productive year for me, not driven by any particular goal
but rather a general interest in a few choice authors and compelling
works. Here are some of the highlights.

## Murakami

I read four different books by Haruki Murakami this year, starting
with _What I Talk About When I Talk About Running_ and following up
with _Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World_, _Men Without
Women_, and _The Wind-up Bird Chronicle_.

This Murakami binge all started from a friend's recommendation, before
2023 I was unacquainted with Murakami's work (although nowadays I
notice the ever-growing Murakami section in my local
bookstore). Beginning with his memoir is perhaps a strange way to meet
a new author, offering insights into the mind behind books that I've
not yet encountered. At least with Murakami's memoir the subject stays
focused to his running and philosophy of life, it doesn't delve far
into the subject matter of his stories.

Something about the tone of _What I Talk About_ caught me as striking:
a relatively simple form of prose packed with emotion and
relatability. This feeling translates into all of Muarakami's writing
and is probably the core reason I find his work so engaging. I
struggle to put into words my reasons for recommending his work to
others, other than I think people should try it and find for
themselves whether it holds any meaning in their lives.

_Hard-Boiled Wonderland_ strikes me as one of his tighter novels, at
least in terms of a plot through-line and characters that grow
together with the protagonist. It's an interesting take on a dual
narrative, two parallel worlds representing the "Hard Boiled"
detective side and the "End of the World" dream side. Although I
didn't care much for the characters themselves, the themes and
existential explorations were incredibly fun to explore.

_Men Without Women_ is a short story collection that I purposefully
read before watching the movie _Drive My Car_, which itself is based
on several of the stories in the book. The stories are interesting,
engaging, and dreamy. Unlike a full-length novel, a short story
doesn't need to work double-time to justify the existence and
evolution of its characters. The constraints of a short story work in
concert with Muarakami's style and I think offer a more enjoyable
reading experience. I think this short story collection is pretty
fantastic and would heartily recommend it.

The final Murakami novel that I read was _The Wind-up Bird Chronicle_,
which I had described to me as his magnum opus. Although I finished it
more than two months ago I am still trying to sort out my feelings
towards it. It has stuck in the back of my mind in a way that few
novels ever have, and I find myself dwelling on certain scenes and
characters to connect their meaning to events in my own life. It's a
bizarre book that I can't necessarily recommend, even though I find it
endless fascinating.

## Doom

John Romero released an autobiography this year, _Doom Guy: Life in
First Person_, which despite the title is an engaging glimpse into an
incredibly formative period in video game history. There are now two
books (that I know of) covering this period of history: _Masters of
Doom_, probably one of the most famous books written about video
games, and Romero's autobiography. I would not recommend Romero's
_Doom Guy_ over _Masters of Doom_, as the latter does a much better
job developing the behind-the-scenes drama and pacing itself as a
proper story. However, _Doom Guy_ is still a worthy read for
Doom-heads like me, as it provides lots of additional insight into
Romero's evolution as a game designer.

Doom is still going strong, 2023 marking its 30 year
anniversary. Following _Doom Guy_ I went down a pretty deep modding
rabbit hole, exploring some of the incredible stuff that people are
making for this
game. [MyHouse.wad](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134292-myhousewad/)
in particular is an astounding achievement that is worth checking out,
at the very least in [Youtube

still churning out new levels in the form of

## The Left Hand of Darkness

Ursula K. Le Guin is quickly becoming one of my favorite Sci-fi
authors. Last year _The Dispossessed_ gripped me with its prose, use
of metaphor, and occasional Taoist reference; I wrote a little bit
about my reading experience
[here](./2022-08-13-reading-the-dispossessed.md). _The Left Hand of
Darkness_ is a very different story that encompasses many of the
things I enjoyed about _The Dispossessed_, but also delivers such
complexity in its alien culture that it's unbelievable to me that it's
only 400 pages. The world-building is so sincere and empathetic it's
hard to believe that Le Guin didn't travel to these planets and
interview her characters personally.

While writing this post I've also finished _Under the Lathe of
Heaven_, which to me reads more like Philip K. Dick than Le Guin. The
reason I bring up this point is to contrast _The Left Hand of
Darkness_, which I think delivers a style so personal and unique to
Le Guin that I can't help believing it will be my favorite work of
hers for a long time.

I can't say enough good things about this book!

## Lisping

The percentage of non-fiction that I read is much smaller than
fiction, both because I think fiction is more important to read from a
learning and development standpoint (a view that I think differs from
the norm) and because fiction interests me more. When I read
non-fiction it's almost always a book about programming, something
directly related to my career and skill development.

Readers of this blog may have guessed, and I confirm, that my Emacs
obsession has likewise taken over my non-fiction life. Emacs, it
seems, is the gateway drug to an obsession with parentheses, one that
inevitably leads down the Common Lisp rabbit hole, into a place where
programmers are trapped in the 80s but also have lots of free and
venerable literature to choose from.

One of such books is Paul Graham's _On Lisp_, a Common Lisp book that
focuses on bottom-up programming and the power of macros. It's the
first Common Lisp book that I've worked through that isn't exclusively
about the language (like _Practical Common Lisp_, also excellent) but
factors in higher-level ideas. _On Lisp_ is widely regarded as the
"macro explainer" because it does an excellent job demonstrating the
power of Lisp macros during the early periods of application
architecture. I can likewise agree that _On Lisp_ has given me a
greater appreciation for macros and metaprogramming, as well as a
great respect for the parentheses that rule Lisp-like languages.
